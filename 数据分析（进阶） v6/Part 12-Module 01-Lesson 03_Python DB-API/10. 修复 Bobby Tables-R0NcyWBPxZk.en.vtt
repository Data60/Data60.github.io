00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.046
So here's where we're executing the
insert query and the AddPost function.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.420
And now if we change this to just
have a comma and a tuple after here,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.530
after this percent s, and
make sure to have enough parentheses,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.261
we should have a forum that's safe
against the SQL injection attack.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.460
Let's try it out.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.680
And here's a test post that has
a single quote in it, and sure enough,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.200
that worked.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.520
Let's try the attack query again.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.090
Single quote, paren, semicolon, delete
from posts, semicolon, dash, dash.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.110
And this time, we're successfully
treating that as just text and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.910
not a piece of SQL.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.770
Awesome.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.790
With that simple change, we foiled one
of the most infamous security holes

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.260
a database-backed web app can have.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.540
Just remember that whenever
you execute an insert query,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.910
make sure to use query parameters
instead of string substitution.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.080
In case you forget,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.060
here's what the Psycopg 2 documentation
has to say on the matter.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.760
Warning, never, never, never use
Python string concatenation, plus, or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.110
string parameters interpolation,
percent,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.340
to pass variables to an SQL query
string, not even at gunpoint.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.309
And they give the same
format that we just used.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.870
Now personally, I don't think we really
need to have documentation that tells us

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.360
what to do at gunpoint, but
we all do have a right to secure code.
