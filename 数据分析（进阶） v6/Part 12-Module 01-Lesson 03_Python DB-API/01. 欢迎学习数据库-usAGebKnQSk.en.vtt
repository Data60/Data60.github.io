Welcome back,
in this lesson you'll learn how to

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.470
connect Python code
into an SQL database.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.490
You'll be running a miniature web
forum on your own machine, and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.270
adapting it's code to
use a database backend.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.250
Then you'll be finding and
fixing some of the most common and

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.180
serious bugs, affecting database
backed web applications, and

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.290
fixing the damage that they
can cause to your database.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.950
By the end of this lesson, you'll know
not only how to use SQL from Python, but

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.770
how to use it in a way that's secure and
reliable.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.420
Let's get to it.
