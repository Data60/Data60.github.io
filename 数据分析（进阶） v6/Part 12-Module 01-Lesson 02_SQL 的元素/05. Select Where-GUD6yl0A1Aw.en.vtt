00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.080
So here's the same
query you saw earlier.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.939
Now let's break it down a little bit.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.410
Like we saw before, whenever we want
to fetch data out of the database,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.930
we'll begin our query
with the keyword select.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.310
Then we say, which columns we
want to see in the result?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.380
And then what tables
they're going to come from?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.070
Then we have this where
thing at the end.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.640
That's the restriction, and it says
what kind of rows we want to see.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.410
Here, we only want to see rows
where the species is gorilla, but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.190
what if we want to restrict
on more than one thing?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.430
We can do that.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910
SQL supports the boolean and.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
Just like python does.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.620
If we want to find out the birth date of
Max the gorilla, we can do it like this.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.390
SQL also supports the or and
not operators, also like in python.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.490
So given what we've just seen,
how might we find the names of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.930
all of the animals that are not
gorillas, and are not named Max?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.010
Try that on the next page.
