Wow, that was a lot of stuff,
and too many animals.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.090
Next lesson,
we'll get out of the zoo and

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.570
get back on the web, without
bringing any exotic spiders with us.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.360
In this lesson, you've seen the basics
of two SQL statements, select for

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.080
fetching data from the database, and
insert for adding rows to the database.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.430
You've applied joins and aggregations
to answer a variety of questions.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.270
In lesson three, you'll be
connecting your database powers to

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.110
your python programming skills,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.420
by adapting an existing web service
to use a back end database.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.050
You're going to be running that
service on your own computer.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.620
So before we go on, you'll need to
download the database software, and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.600
an environment to run it in.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.320
I've put a link about how to do that,
in the instructor notes below.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.980
Once you have that
software downloaded and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.150
installed, I'll see you
again in less than three.
