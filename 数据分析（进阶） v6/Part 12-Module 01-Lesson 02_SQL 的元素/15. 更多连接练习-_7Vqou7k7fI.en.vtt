00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.140
Okay, so here are two other
tables in the zoo database.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.510
The first one, taxonomy,
gives the scientific names for

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.300
all our animal species.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.700
We've been using the common names
like brown bear in our other tables.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.680
This table gives not quite the full
taxonomic name but a lot of it.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.940
The brown bear is genus Ursus.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.760
Species arctos.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.740
And the family Ursidae.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
And the oder Carnivora.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.730
We have to call this column
t_order instead of order,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.700
because order is a reserved
word in SQL for order buy.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.820
The t is for taxonomy.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.710
And if we look in this table over here,
we'll see the common names for

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.330
all of the orders.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.060
Bats belong in the order Chiroptera and
lizards and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.580
snakes belong to the order Squamata.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.730
and llamas and moose and warthogs all
belong to the order Artiodactyla.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.850
Okay, okay, so

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
really these tables are just here
to give you more stuff to join.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.290
Big surprise.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.060
This time we want to find out which
orders have the most individual animals

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.040
in the zoo, and we want to give
their common names like monotremes,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.860
instead of their scientific
names like monotremata.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.390
So you'll probably need to use both
of those tables, the taxonomy and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.090
the order names table, plus the animals
table with the individual animals in it.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.090
So the problem is, to list the taxonomic
orders by their common names,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.200
sorted by how many individual animals
we have of each order in the zoo.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.000
To see the full schemas the tables,
take a look at the instructor notes.
