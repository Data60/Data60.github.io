00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.950
So here is the question you
were asked to answer, and

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.330
here is one possible answer.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.340
Select name from animals where
species equals llama, and

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.000
birthdate is greater than or equal to
the beginning of 1995, January 1, 1995.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.210
And birthdate is less than or
equal to December 31, 1998.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.750
So, just as when you did this manually,
your query should have found one llama,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.220
Allison the llama.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.630
Now we can have the database
find our llamas for us,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.520
instead of doing it by hand.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.470
This is a pretty big help if we
have lots and lots of llamas.
