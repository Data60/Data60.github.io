00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.080
Okay.
Now that you've got a list of all of

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.810
their tables and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.590
all of their columns, I want to give
you a chance to mess around with them.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.390
On the next page,
you can run whatever queries you like,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.530
using the zoo database.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.690
You'll see a bunch of queries
commented out in the editor.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.180
Try uncommenting each of them and
running it.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.620
Some of them use features
you haven't seen yet.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.120
Try to figure out what each
of those features does.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.570
There's no right or wrong here, whatever
you put in the query variable will

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.640
run against the database, when you press
test run, and you'll see the results.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.659
Once you go on to the next page
feel free to bookmark it, so

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.180
you can come back later, any time you
want to test out some SQL syntax.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.340
Once you're done use
the submit button to move on.
