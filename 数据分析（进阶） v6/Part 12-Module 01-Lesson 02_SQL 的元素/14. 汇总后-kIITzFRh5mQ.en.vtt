00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.730
So for
this question there was just one answer.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.960
The unusual food, was snakes.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.380
The zoo has only one animal, that eats
snakes and that's our mongoose, Ricky.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.000
And that's a good thing too, because
we've got some python, coming up in

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.440
the next lesson, and we wouldn't want it
to be eaten up by a bunch of mongooses.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.720
Or is it mongeese?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.330
Or mongosslings?
