00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.090
So this is one possible answer.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.970
Insert into animals values wibble, which
is just the name I gave the possum.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.830
You can call it whatever you like.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.600
The species, and then the birthdate.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.510
Here's another option,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.320
we could explicitly say what
columns we're inserting into.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.030
Even though these are in the same order,
it's still okay to do this.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.330
And by the way, that's pretty much
all there is to the insert statement.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.970
It's a lot simpler than
the select statement.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.020
Select queries can express
arbitrary complicated searches and

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.280
aggregations of data, but inserts
are just add this row to this table.
