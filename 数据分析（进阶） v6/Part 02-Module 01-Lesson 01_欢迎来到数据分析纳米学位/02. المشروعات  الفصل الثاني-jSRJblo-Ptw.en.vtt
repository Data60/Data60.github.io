00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.540
In this term, you'll be working on projects to deepen

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.769
your understanding of the data analysis process.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.730
The first project will have you analyzing data

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.065
collected from people performing the Stroop task.

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:15.404
A test of our ability to separate the visual and semantic content of words.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:20.890
We'll use statistics to explore psychological effects associated with this task.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.250
Most of the data you'll be working with in an actual job,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.574
will contain a bunch of errors and other general mess.

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:29.789
In the second project, you'll gather data from a variety of sources,

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.609
assess its quality untidiness and then clean it.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.505
We'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook,

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:40.495
analyze the cleaned up data and report your results through visualizations.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:42.044
The third project, you'll apply

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:46.715
exploratory data analysis techniques to gain an understanding of a data set.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.245
You'll explore how variables are distributed,

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:53.789
any relationships between variables and check for outliers and anomalies.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.954
Finally, for the fourth project,

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:58.969
you'll use Tableau to create visualizations from a data set,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.210
that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.109
Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.998
of data visualization such as visual encodings,

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:12.300
design principles and effective communication.
