00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.730
You can add a new empty table to your
database with the create table command.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.900
When you create a table, you'll give
the name of the table, and the names and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870
the types of each column.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.650
You can also set constraints on each
column and on the row as a whole.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.320
We'll talk about constraints shortly,
but for now, let's focus on types.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.200
Here's the simplest form of the create
table command that doesn't have any

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.330
constraints, only columns with their
types, and gives the table a name.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.640
Now, we've dealt with text and integer
types previously, and back in lesson

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.380
two, I gave you a big, long list of lots
and lots of types that SQL supports.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.690
The exact set of types that you can use
will vary from system to system though.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.870
If you're working with a database system
that doesn't natively support the type

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.070
you need,
there's usually a way to work around it.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.980
For instance,
PostgreSQL has a specific type for

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.380
IP addresses, but MySQL does not.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.645
MySQL programmers usually use an integer
or a text string to store IP addresses.

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:02.475
Of the databases we've used in this
course, PostgreSQL has a proper type for

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:07.615
dates and times, but SQLite actually
just stores dates as strings.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:10.885
Database systems will often give you
shortcuts to declare a particular

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:12.255
kind of column.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:16.145
For instance, in PostgreSQL, you can
have a column that stores the time and

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:17.730
date along with the time zone so

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.670
you can do comparisons of data recorded
in different places around the world.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.363
The full SQL standard name for that
column type is timestamp with time zone,

00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:32.710
but PostgreSQL let's us
abbreviate it as timestamptz.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.250
Normally, if you're creating
a database for a new application,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.260
you'll set up the database upfront as
part of the installation procedure.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.010
It's technically possible to send create
table commands from your app code, but

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.350
it's usually a bad idea to do
that outside of initial setup.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.720
Your database design is really
a part of your app's code.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.030
It's just a part written in
SQL instead of in Python.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.250
So, creating tables isn't like creating
values in your program's variables.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.000
It's more like having your
app rewrite its own code.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.470
That's not something that's very common.
