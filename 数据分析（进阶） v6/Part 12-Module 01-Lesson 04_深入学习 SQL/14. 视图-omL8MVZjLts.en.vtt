00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.340
Whether you can update or

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.330
delete from views at all, depends on the database system.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.689
In SQLite, you just can't.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:06.910
It doesn't support it.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.240
But in PostqreSQL, you can update or delete on simple views,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.600
like ones that select just particular rows or columns from a large table.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.710
But not from views that use drawing, aggregations, or other functions.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.640
The change to the view will effect the underlying table that it's a view of.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.620
So, the answer is that yes, you can update or

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.860
delete rows from some views but not others.
