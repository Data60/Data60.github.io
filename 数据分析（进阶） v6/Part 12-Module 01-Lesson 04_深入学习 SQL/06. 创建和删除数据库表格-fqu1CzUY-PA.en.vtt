00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.170
When you want to use a database
in your application,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.300
first you need to create
the database and give it a name.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.180
You'll use the create
database thread for this.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.620
The name you give it here,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.300
is the same name you'll use to connect
to the database from your code.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.790
The opposite of create in SQL is drop.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.240
I'm not sure why.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.130
Maybe database programmers
used to be really clumsy.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.220
Anyway, the way to remove a data base,
is drop database.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.270
And the way to remove
a table is drop table.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.860
All of these commands have options,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.610
you can look up in the documentation
if you ever need them.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.840
When you drop a data base or

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.770
a table, there's no confirmation, no
did you really mean to do that warning.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.400
So don't do it,
if you don't really mean it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.500
Once you've created a database in psql,
you'll want to connect to it.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.870
You can do that using
the backslash C command,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.940
followed by the database's name.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.540
By the way, you can't drop
a database that you're connected to.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.235
Try these commands on your
own in your VM using psql.

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:01.905
First, create a new database called
fishies, or whatever you'd like.

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:02.905
Once you've created it,

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:07.325
switch psql's connection over to
that database, with \c fishies.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:10.805
Then create a table,
make one of the columns a text column,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:12.765
one of the columns a serial column.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.985
Then try inserting some values
with the text column and

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.120
selecting some rows from the table.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.160
What do you think will
happen in the serial column,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.980
when you insert a row that
doesn't give it a value?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.860
Try it in psql.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.020
What was it that actually happened?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.000
Then after that,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.410
try finding a description of this
behavior in the post SQL documentation.
