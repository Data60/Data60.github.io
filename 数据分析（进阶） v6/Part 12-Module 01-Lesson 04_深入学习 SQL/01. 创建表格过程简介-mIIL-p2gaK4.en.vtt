00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.980
So far in this course,
you've worked with databases and

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.310
tables that were already created.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.109
In this lesson,
you'll learn to define new tables and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.290
declare the relationships between them.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.040
We'll begin by revisiting some of what
you already know about table structure,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.190
and we'll build on that with the SQL
syntax for creating tables and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.860
linking them together.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.540
Then you'll learn some
powerful tricks for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.900
doing things using SQL that you might
otherwise do in your python code.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.160
This can help your code run faster and
more reliably.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.830
Let's get started.
