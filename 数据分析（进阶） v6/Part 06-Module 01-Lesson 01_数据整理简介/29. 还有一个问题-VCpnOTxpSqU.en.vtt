00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.214
Before we wrap up this lesson,

00:00:02.214 --> 00:00:05.560
I want to show you one more quick analysis into this.

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:10.529
I did some minor exploration and enhanced the data a bit to produce these,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.619
which are things we'll cover in our exploratory data analysis course.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.570
So I wanted to see if data related jobs are in

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.179
demand and if there are any notable trends.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.403
Ignore all the fancy code here,

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:35.619
feel free to dig into if you'd like but it's not really the core aspect of this bit.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:37.549
So here is a line plot.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.299
On the x axis we have year and on

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.589
the y axis we have the percentage of job postings that are data

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.540
related which I've roughly defined as

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.214
postings that have the word data in their job title or job description.

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:59.060
So notice percentage and not total.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.420
This is another rate versus total situation like the one we encountered in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.579
my personal wrangling example for that hockey analysis.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.359
There are fewer job postings in the earlier years like 2004,

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.650
2005 compared to 2014 and 2015,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.490
so it will be unfair to compare totals.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.079
I told you we'd encounter another decision like this.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.060
So, look at that trend.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.612
The demand for data skills looks to be on the rise in this data set,

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:31.040
which corroborates what we're

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:41.010
hearing in the media.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.330
There is a link to this article in the notes below but we create

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.480
2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day says IBM,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.719
one of Udacity's hiring partners,

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.939
which is so much that 90 percent of the data in the world day,

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.250
has been created in the last two years alone.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.635
This new influx of data means data skills have become hugely important but also scarce,

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:09.000
relative to that need.
