00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.880
Welcome to introduction to relational
data bases, relational data

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.390
bases are one of the back end
developer's most powerful tools.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.070
By the end of this course,
you'll be able to organize and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.450
store your application's data
in a relational data base.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.720
You'll practice the basics of SQL,
the language for querying and

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.770
populating databases, and

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.890
you'll be able to write Python code to
serve a web app backed by a data base.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.680
And to use the database as a tool for
answering new questions.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.990
Let's talk about what we're going
to in each lesson of this course.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.619
In the first lesson you'll learn
some concepts about how we

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.140
organize data in relational databases.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.650
In the second, you'll learn how to use
SQL to fetch data out of a database, and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.610
insert new data into it.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.700
The third lesson will cover
the Python database API,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.980
which let's you hook your Python
code up to a database server, and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.910
you'll be adapting a web
application to use a database.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.550
The fourth lesson will deal
with defining new tables and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490
performing more advanced queries.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.950
And finally we'll pull it altogether
into a project using a database to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.210
plan a game tournament.
