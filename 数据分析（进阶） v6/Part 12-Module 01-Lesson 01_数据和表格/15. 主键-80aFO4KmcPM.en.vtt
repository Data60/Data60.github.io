00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.690
A college-issued ID number is
a good example of a primary key.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.760
It's a unique identifier that somebody
has issued for just this purpose.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.330
As long as everyone in the course
is an enrolled student,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.610
they will have a unique ID.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.660
Home mailing address is
not a valid primary key.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.550
What would happen if you had two
students taking the course who live in

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.040
the same house?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.870
Students' email address might
be an okay primary key.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.870
College students don't share
email addresses with each other,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.630
so this is a correct choice.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.520
But it isn't a great primary key though,
because people sometimes change their

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.540
email addresses and that can be annoying
to work around in your application.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.470
Date of birth is not
a valid primary key.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.500
There's a famous math example called
the birthday problem that proves that

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.990
you only need 23 people in a room to
have a 50/50 chance of two people in

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.950
the room sharing a birthday.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.670
Also, college students are frequently
around the same age, so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.190
there's a good chance that two students
will share the same date of birth.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
In any event, a primary key
shouldn't just be maybe unique.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.920
It has to be definitely unique.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.020
Finally, driver's license
numbers are unique,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.260
at least if you also include what state
or country the driver's license is from.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.890
The problem with this though, is that
not everyone has a driver's license.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.510
Some people don't drive.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.080
And so, some students could
have no value at all for

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.150
this column and that would make
it not a valid primary key
