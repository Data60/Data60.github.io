00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.370
Okay, let's do a quiz.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.270
Our zoo, it turns out,
needs a database to keep track of

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.230
all the people who have
donated money to the zoo.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.490
One of our programmers has come up
with an object oriented description of

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.080
a donor class.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.100
It has attributes for

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.250
a person's name, and their favorite
animal, and their phone numbers.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.490
That way for instance, when there's
a new born baby gorilla in the zoo,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.110
the zoo keepers can call Mary up,
and tell her about it.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.620
For phone numbers,
a person might have more than one.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.580
So we'll support home and
mobile, and work phone numbers.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.940
So if we want to store this
information in a relational database,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.050
instead of just in objects in memory,
how many tables do you think we'll need?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.810
Oh, wait, not that kind of tables.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.350
This kind of table.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.610
Because a person can have more than one
phone number, we're going to want to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.550
have one table for donors, and
one for donor's phone numbers.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.190
This is the same sort of situation,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.760
as when we had animals that eat
multiple different kinds of food.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.140
Now, what's going to go in these tables?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.170
First, what columns do you
think might go in these tables?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.000
And second,
how would you represent Mary and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.690
her two phone numbers in these columns?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.920
Fill in the column names in
the top of each table, and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.660
then the values that you'd put
in them in the table body.
