00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.480
Earlier, I told you that database
tables were a lot like the tables you

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.570
might see in an infographic or
a reference book.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.390
There are some differences though.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.190
One of these is important when there
are multiple answers to a question,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.230
which will often be the case just before
we use a count or another aggregation.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.260
This table is about animals and
what they eat.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.130
Unlike some tables we've seen before,
this one sometimes has

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.790
the same value in some of the cells
with different values over here.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.530
This is how we say things like
brown bears eat fish and meat and

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.540
plants in a database table.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.780
We split that sentence out
into multiple sentences,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.200
which make multiple rows in the table.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.630
Why don't we just make
multiple columns or

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.790
put several values in one column
separated with commas or something?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.010
There are lots of
reasons not to do that.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.620
If we tried using multiple columns for
the different foods each animal eats,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.570
we wouldn't know how many
columns to make in advance.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.370
Some animals do eat a lot more kinds
of foods than others after all.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.120
And what's more, we want to be able
to use counts and other aggregations.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.090
And those will only work if we have
our data separated out into rows,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.809
not jammed together.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.606
Now let's take a look at a real
database query against this table.

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:14.700
Select food from diet where
species equals orangutan.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640
This looks almost like ordinary English,
but

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.190
this is actually an SQL database query.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.370
It's asking the database to return
particular data from the diet table.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.480
In a moment, we'll run this
query using an actual database.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.910
But before we do,
can you figure out which rows and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.630
which columns from this
table it will return?
