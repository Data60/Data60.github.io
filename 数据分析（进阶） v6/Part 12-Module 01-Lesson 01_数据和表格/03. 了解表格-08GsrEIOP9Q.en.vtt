00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.360
The more that I think about it,
is that all of the values in a row,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.440
are part of the same sentence
describing something.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.986
For instance,
describing the country of Columbia.

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:14.370
Columbia has a population of 47
million and the literacy rate of 94%.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.760
And all of the values in a column,
are ones that have the same role or

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.376
place, in different sentences.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:23.690
So, this number, describes about Brazil,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.510
the same sort of a fact, that this
number describes about Colombia.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.890
They're both population figures,
but for different countries.
