00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
So at this point, you've actually gathered

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:05.040
enough data to produce one of the goal visualizations,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.919
to scatterplot with quadrants with audience score

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.539
on the horizontal axis and critics score in the vertical axis.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.774
Since this lesson is on gathering data,

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:17.550
let's get past the assessing and cleaning steps of the data wrangling process,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.100
which includes joining our two dataframes,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
and let's flashforward to the final product, the visualization.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.190
So here's what the data frame looks like with

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.000
your newly gathered audience score and number of audience ratings.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.435
You can use matplotlib to create a simple visualization like this one,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:34.965
a pretty basic scatterplot,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:39.325
but this is where something interactive like Tableau really shines.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.859
And here's what it looks like in Tableau. Pretty amazing.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.090
So, you've got audience score on the horizontal axis ranging from 70% to 100%,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.375
critics score in the vertical axis ranging from 91% to 100%,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.890
well technically, 101, but that's just for visual purposes.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.219
Then you've got these reference lines.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
The vertical one being the median of audience score, which is 90%,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.159
and the horizontal reference line is the median of critics score, 98%.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.594
In the top right corner of the screen,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:11.939
we've even got number of audience ratings and number

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.810
of critic ratings represented visually, too.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.969
Lighter shades of blue mean small number of

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.164
audience ratings and darker shades of blue means a larger number.

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.300
And smaller circles mean a smaller number of critic ratings

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.795
and larger circles mean a larger number of critic ratings.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.564
And okay, so in the top right corner of the screen,

00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:31.829
we've got universally loved movies.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.170
High audience scores, high critics scores.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.530
One of them being The Godfather, 1972,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.219
which if we hover over this dot,

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.049
we can see the 99% critics score and the 98% audience score.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.504
And in the bottom right corner,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.354
we've got critically underrated movies.

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:50.745
Audience scores above the median audience score for this top 100 list

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:54.785
and critics scores below the median critics score for this top 100 list.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:56.989
One movie being The Dark Knight,

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:01.280
2008, audience score and critics score of 94%.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.030
And in the top left, we have critically overrated movies.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.194
Audiences didn't like these movies as much as critics did, basically.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.784
Compared to the median audience and critic rating,

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:13.514
the most notable point, 1940's, Pinocchio.

00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:19.875
A 100% critics score over 45 reviews but only a 72% audience score.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.379
And then in the bottom left quadrant,

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.419
we've got movies that didn't have

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.334
particularly high critic or audience scores in reference to the movies on this list.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.340
One notable one, Lala Land, 2016,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.469
an audience score of 82% and a critics score of 92%,

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.365
both well below the median scores for each.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:41.165
And here's E.T., right on the median critics score line,

00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:46.569
a 98% critics score and there's that low 72% audience score.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.294
So, this Best of Rotten Tomatoes critic versus audience score visualization

00:02:50.294 --> 00:02:54.724
required gathering data from two different sources: Accessing files on hand,

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:59.269
and scraping data from web pages and that data was in two different formats,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.015
a flat file, or a TSV file specifically,

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:04.369
and HTML. Great job.
