00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.059
Hi there. Welcome to the second term of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:07.365
In the first term, we covered Python,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.824
a few frameworks such as NumPy and Pandas,

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.665
getting data from databases with SQL,

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.240
and making decisions using statistics.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.660
In this term, you'll learn about the data analysis process.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.980
You'll start by extracting and cleaning data,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.410
a test typically called data wrangling.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.170
This is where you'll spend the bulk of your time as a data analyst.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.635
Then you'll get experience exploring data.

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:29.980
In this step of the process,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.560
you'll develop an understanding of the data by looking at distributions,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.060
summary statistics and correlations.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.405
Finally, you'll learn about visualizing data.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.115
This is where you share the results of your analysis.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:44.579
It's one of the most important skills to have as an analyst,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.219
communicating what you found with others.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.924
After completing this term,

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.989
you'll have the skills necessary to be a data analyst.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.050
You'll also be prepared to continue on to more advanced topics,

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.000
such as machine learning. Cheers.
