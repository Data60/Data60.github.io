00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.750
So far in this course, when you've
written SQL queries in the web-based

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.590
editor, we've hidden away the mechanism
that actually connects to a database and

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.410
runs your queries.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.320
Some place back here, there's actually
a database running those queries.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.480
Now let's open up this box and
see how it actually works.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.120
Behind our web server,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.603
we're running Python code that connects
to a SQLite database using DB-API calls.

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:27.190
The Python DB-API isn't the library.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.000
It's a standard for

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.260
Python libraries that let's your
code connect to databases.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990
There are dozens of
different libraries for

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.790
different database systems
that follow this standard.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.590
The standard specifies what functions
you'll call to connect to a database,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.100
to send queries, and to get results.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.970
So, if you learn the DB-API functions,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.780
you can apply that knowledge
with any database system.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.220
Although the details of what each
database can do are different,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.080
adapting Python code from one to
another is quite straightforward.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.730
But each database system
has its own library.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.260
And as you can see, some of the library
names are a little bit different from

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.880
the names of the database
systems that we work with.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.460
For exercises in the browser,
we use the sqlite3 library.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.410
When you run database code
on your own machine for

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.040
this course though,
you'll be using the psycopg2 library,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670
which let's your code talk
to the PostgreSQL database.
