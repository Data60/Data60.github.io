00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.160
So before you made that change,
I asked you to think about whether it

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.110
would be better to clean bad stuff out
of posts as soon as the user sends them,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.770
before we put them in the database or
whether we should put them

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.630
into the database as they are and
clean them up before we display them.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.150
It turns out that there
are arguments both ways.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.670
Usually you'll hear programmers talk
about input sanitization, meaning that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.180
we clean bad stuff out of user input,
before we do anything at all with it,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.480
that way if someone later displays
the stored posts using another app.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.980
They don't have to worry about bad
stuff hiding, in the database.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.600
But on the other hand, if we wanted
an accurate record of what users have

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.340
sent to us, maybe we want to preserve
bad input in the database, and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.660
do output sanitization instead.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.600
People have different opinions,
about which of these is best.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.190
Right now, since we already have
live bad stuff in the database,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.180
we definitely need to sanitize output.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.500
But we could sanitize input as well.
