So maybe it updating was
the wrong thing here.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.980
We got rid of the spam, but
now we have way too much cheese.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
Let's find out how to get rid
of the cheesy posts entirely.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.790
Remember how bobby tables
deleted all of our posts once?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.260
It was with the delete statement,
but delete can be used for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.920
good as well as for evil.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.590
We just need to be a little
selective with it.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.990
Just like select and update, the delete
statement can take a where restriction.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.430
And just as with update, you can task
that where restriction by using it in

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.370
the select,
before you go deleting anything.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.330
And now you can probably clean all of
the cheese out of your database with

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.960
a single command.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.580
When you're done, reload the forum and
see that all the cheese posts have gone.
