Let's put an end to this spam nonsense.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.540
We need to make sure that the data
in the content column will always be

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.050
treated as having the same meaning,
as text, not as JavaScript code.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.770
As it turns out,
there's a really good Python library for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.740
doing this called bleach.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.690
It's installed on your VM already, so
you can import it right into your code.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.910
Have a read through
the bleach documentation,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.160
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.120
Once you do that, you can use bleach
to stop unsafe HTML from ever

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480
getting from an attacker through
your database back to a user.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.610
Go ahead and
make that change to the forum code,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
but here's something to think about
when you do, do you think it would be

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.720
better to clean bad stuff out of posts
before we store them in the data base?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.470
Or should we store whatever
the user sends us and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.520
then clean the bad stuff out before
we display those posts in the forum?
