00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.480
It turns out that serial isn't really
a data type at all, it's shorthand for

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.029
the integer type,
plus a special default value.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.680
When we create a serial column,
the database does a bunch of work for

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.530
us to make sure that column
gets populated correctly.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.290
It makes something called a sequence,
which is an internal data structure and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.720
sets that as the default value for
the column.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.002
That's what you saw when you
looked at the ID column for

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.240
the forums post table in
the last lesson, by the way.
