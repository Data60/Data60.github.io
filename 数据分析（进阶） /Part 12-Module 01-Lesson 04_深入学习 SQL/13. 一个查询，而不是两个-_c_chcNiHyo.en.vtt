00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.040
So, here's one possible answer.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.050
Inside these parentheses,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.400
is a select statement that
returns the average weight.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.270
We call this table subQ,
because SQL makes us give it some name,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.470
even though we don't use that name.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.410
And then we're joining that
back to player's table, and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.930
then doing a where restriction for

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.280
rows where the player's weight,
is less than the computed average.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.300
Let's look at that in more detail.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.660
First, start with the sub query.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.880
It does an average aggregation.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.980
Producing this little one
by one table called a subq.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.230
Then, that gets joined
to the players table.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.500
Making this one.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.060
This then gets filtered, for entries
where weight is less than average.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.490
Finally, we just take the name and
the weight columns.
