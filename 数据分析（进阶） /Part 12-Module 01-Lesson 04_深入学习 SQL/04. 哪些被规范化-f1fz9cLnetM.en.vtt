00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.030
So in this first case, we have three
columns, student name, teacher name, and

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.710
the student's grade.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.450
One of the rules for normalization is
that we have to have a unique key,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.240
that says what each row is about,
but names aren't unique.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.730
If we have two students named
Jake Smith, or Pavel Ivanov, or

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.970
something else,
this isn't going to do very well.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.500
Also, if a student is taking two courses
taught by the same teacher like,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.820
maybe a CS and a math course.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.440
We'll have problems there, too.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.780
So this is not normalized.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.890
Over here, we also have a single table.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.500
Here we've given each
student a unique id number.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.270
And we're also using a unique id for

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.900
courses, instead of just
the teacher's name.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.640
But, we're storing facts that don't have
to do with each other in the same table.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.070
Like student 23 is always Jake Smith,
regardless of what course he's taking.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.900
This really ought to be split into two
tables, so this is also not normalized.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.280
And splitting it into two tables,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.710
is exactly what we've
done in this third group.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.350
One table that gives the relationship
between each student id and their name.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.129
And the other gives the grade for
each course they take.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.100
If all we know is a student's name,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.700
we can join this against
that to find their courses.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.000
But, if there are two students with
the same name, we will get both.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.290
Nonetheless, this is normalized.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.320
And the fourth group,
the only difference between this one and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.450
that one, is that here, we're also
keeping track of students' birth dates.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.540
But a person only has one birth date.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.140
And the birth date, doesn't have
anything to do with their grades.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.130
So adding this column to this table,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.920
doesn't make this any less
normalized than this one.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.060
So this and this, are both normalized.
