00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.969
So we wanted to find all of
the animals that are not gorillas and

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.000
also not named Max.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.740
So we could do it this way.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.990
Select name from animals where
not species equals gorilla,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.460
and not name equals Max.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.170
Or here's another way we can do it.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.519
There's a logic rule
called Demorgans law,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.103
that let's us switch not X and
not Y into not X or Y.

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:29.857
So we can say select name
from animals where not

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:34.484
parenthesis species equals gorilla or
name equals max.

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:36.550
That will do the same thing.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.330
Or hey, here's a third way.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.960
SQL supports the not equals or bang
equals operator, just like python does.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.540
So we can say, select name from animals,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.690
where species not equals gorilla,
and name not equals Max.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.630
Any one of those three
will work just fine.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.690
They'll all produce the same results.
