Okay, so if you look at the top of your
table, you'll see that we have even

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.510
more even toed ungulates or

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.820
Even the carnivores don't come close.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.920
And if you scroll way down to
the bottom of the output you saw,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.720
now the dolphins and whales.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.700
And what exactly is a narwhal
doing in a zoo anyway?
