00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.810
In the last quiz, you figured out
which select clauses you'd need to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.800
do some particular queries.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.700
Now let's do one of
those queries in SQL.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180
It's time to take attendance at the zoo.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.250
We need to know how many of
each species we have, and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.500
it would be a big help if we had
the most popular species listed first.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.200
Because, they'll take the most time for
the zookeepers to count.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.120
We've put a cheat sheet of all
the select clauses we've seen so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.822
far, in the instructor notes below
the editor on the next page.

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:30.540
But, you have to put
them together correctly,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.619
into a query that makes sense.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.120
Feel free to take a few tries,
using the test round button.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.270
You'll see the result table down below.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.420
When you've got it, press Submit,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.909
and your query will be tested
against a larger database.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.520
So here's the problem.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.040
Write a query that returns all the
species in the zoo, and how many animals

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.880
of each species there are, sorted with
the most populous species at the top.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.516
And here's an example,
if the zoo had 4 gorillas, 2 alpaca,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:02.050
1 brown bear and no other animals,
then we'd get a result like this.
