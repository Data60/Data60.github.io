00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.630
In this lesson,

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.630
you've learned a lot of concepts that
we'll be applying in this course.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.920
Concepts about structuring data into
tables, extracting data that we want,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.030
counting rows with aggregations and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.470
linking tables together using
primary keys and joins.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.740
In the next lesson,
you'll apply these concepts using SQL,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.170
sending queries to a live database
server and interpreting the results.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.670
See you then.
