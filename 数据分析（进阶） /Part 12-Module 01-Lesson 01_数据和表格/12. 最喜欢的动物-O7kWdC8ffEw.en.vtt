Well, here's a hard problem.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.320

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.260
The bear, or the tiger, or the porcupine fish, or the mantis shrimp?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.240
Everybody's got a different opinion.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.105
Have you ever seen the website, kittenwar.com?

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.665
It's a site where people can upload pictures of their cats, and

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.275
then vote on which kitten is the cutest.

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:23.685
Well, why don't we do the same thing for these zoo animals?

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.975
Let's take a look at what a database for that might look like.
