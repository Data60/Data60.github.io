Let's think about uniqueness.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.890
Imagine you're creating a database
to track students grades in

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.580
a college course.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.470
Which of these pieces of data
would be valid choices for

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.710
a primary key, in the student's table.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.170
Mark every choice that could used
to uniquely identify students,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.740
not just the one you think
would be the best choice.
