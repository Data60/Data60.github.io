00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.660
So, Jones, Tanaka and
Muller are all family names.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.620
I got them from a database, of common
family names in different countries.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.650
Jones is one of the most common
family names in the U.S. and

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.420
in England, and Wales.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.750
Tanaka is one of the most
common family names in Japan.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.188
And Muller, is one of the most common
family names in Germany and Austria.

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:25.150
But Mary J.Washington, isn't a family
name, it's a person's full name.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.610
We wouldn't expect to see
a single database column,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.619
that held full names for some rows,
and just family names for other rows.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.490
So Mary J.Washington
is the correct answer.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.790
So here we've seen that when we think
about pieces of data that might be in

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600
a database, we have to think
not only about their type, but

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.840
also their meaning,
what they represent in the real world.
