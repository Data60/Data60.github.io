00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.280
Okay, so the first thing we're
going to need is an ID column,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.830
because nothing else here is unique.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.500
We'll relate donors to their phone
numbers, using the donor's ID.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.020
The ID is arbitrary, as long as the one
here equals the one down here, but

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.110
we'll just put 1,
because Mary is the first donor.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.630
The second thing we know
about a donor is their name.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.390
And we know their favorite animal.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.470
Now, Mary has two phones, so

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.540
there will be two rows in donor
phones with Mary's id in them.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.049
And Mary has two kinds of phone,
one is a home phone and one is a mobile.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.910
We'll call that column phone type.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.370
And finally we know
Mary's phone numbers.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.450
So there you have it, you've taken
all the data from this object

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.660
oriented record and
structured it into database tables.
