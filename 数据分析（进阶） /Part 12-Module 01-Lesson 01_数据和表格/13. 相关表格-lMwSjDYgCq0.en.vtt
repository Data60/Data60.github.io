00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.550
So a database,
will usually have several tables in it.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.400
Here's how we might start for
our image voting app.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.750
The first table represents pictures
that people have uploaded of animals.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.380
The second represents people's votes.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.320
Fluffy, Monster, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.250
George are all animals,
whose pictures someone has uploaded.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.950
Because, we might have two
animals with the same name.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.960
We give each one a numeric id here.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.190
The pictures tables says
that Fluffy has id 1.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.760
Monster has id 2.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.770
George has id 3.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.830
And so on.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.970
The votes table says, which images
have been displayed together for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.470
voting, and
which one the user picked as the cutest.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.420
Here, the app displayed monster,
ID 2, and George, ID 3,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.970
and the user voted for George.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.250
2 and 3 were matched up,
and 3 was the winner.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.660
Note that in the votes table,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.810
the columns are called left,
right, and winner.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.540
But they match up, to the column
called id in the pictures table.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.000
You can read every row as a sentence.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.270
In the pictures table, the sentences
say Fluffy has id number 1, and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.121
the filename fluffsocute.jpg,
Monster has id number 2,

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:14.290
and filename monstie-basket.png and
so forth.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.350
In the votes table,
the sentences are picture 2 and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.610
picture 3, were displayed and
the user voted for picture 3.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.770
Picture 1 and
picture 3 were displayed, and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.440
the user voted for picture 1 and so on.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.580
So this 3 and this 3, refer to the same
thing, a cute critter with id number 3.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.750
But they're in different tables, and
the columns have different names,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.720
because they play different
roles in different sentences.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.730
Over here we're saying,
which picture has which id?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.070
And over here we're saying, which ones
have been displayed together, and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.490
who got the vote?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.630
So this is the kind of sentence that
this table actually represents.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.200
If you wanted to come up with sentences
like Monster was shown to Fluffy, and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.328
Fluffy got the vote instead
of 2 was shown with 1,

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.280
and 1 got the vote for this row here.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.870
We would have to connect rows from
this table, with rows from that table.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.960
That's something we can do
with a database query as well.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.230
Queries that do this are called joins,
and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.870
we'll be seeing a lot of
them later on in the course.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.630
For now, just remember that
a value with the same meaning,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.850
can occur in different tables and
have different column names, and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.580
that we can derive new tables by
linking up existing tables using joins.
