00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.540
Let's now think about the meaning
of data as distinct from its type.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.410
Here are four pieces of data.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.790
All of them have the same type.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.500
They are all strings.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.480
Jones.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.600
Tanaka.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.150
Mary J Washington.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.630
And Muller.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.960
But which one does not have the same
kind of meaning as the others?
